<a>Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a PhD student of statistics in University of Calgary. I have some very superficial knowledge about time series (mainly in finance) and nonparametric statistics (like empirical likelihood). I am currently learning probability theory and GLMs (generalized linear models). I'm also interested in topics like high-dimensional statistics and functional data analysis, or even machine learning and causal inference. Hope that one day I can understand what they are all talking about.</a>
